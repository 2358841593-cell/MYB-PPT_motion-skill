# PPT Workspace

This folder is managed by `my-ppt-studio`.

Structure:

- `templates/` - script/config templates
- `projects/` - one subfolder per episode

Workflow:

1. Copy `templates/script.template.md` to a new project's `sources/script.md`.
2. Keep all inputs in `sources/` (script + data + assets).
3. Generated outputs go to `build/` (safe to delete).
4. Final deliverables go to `exports/`.
